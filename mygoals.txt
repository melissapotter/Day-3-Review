My goals as a developer is to work collaboratively with a team to build code and come up with solutions for creative projects. I want to be challenged, and I want to work with a team that is enthusiastic and passionate about what they do. Since I have a lot of knowledge of the finance industry, I want to work for a company that is involved in financial technology. This would allow me to utilize the skills I already have in finance and apply them while developing products and/or services for our consumer.
